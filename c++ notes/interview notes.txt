chapter 12.1 pointer & references to the base & derived object
--------------------------------------------------------------
why virtual function is needed ?
	
why dervide object has a base & child part both?
	Since a Derived is-a Base, it is appropriate that Derived contain a Base part.

What is a franken object ?

chapter 12.9 Dynamic casting
------------------------------
why we need a dynamic casting ?	
how to do dynamic cast or what is down casting ?
cases where dynamic cast fails ?
can down cast be possible with static cast & what will be the consequences?
Is down_cast possible with reference & what can be the consequences to it ?
down_cast vs static_cast ?
down_cast vs virtual funcions ?
When you think dynamic cast is the better choice ?
